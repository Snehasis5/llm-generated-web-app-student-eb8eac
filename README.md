## Summary

Create a fully functional web application using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

1. The app should be directly viewable in a browser, hosted via GitHub Pages.
2. Include an index.html as the main entry point.
3. All dependencies must be included via CDN links or simple scripts (no private or local dependencies).
4. Provide an interactive UI demonstrating the app’s functionality (e.g., a simple calculator, a Markdown previewer, or a to-do list).
5. Include a README.md explaining what the app does and how to use it.
6. Ensure the app is self-contained, safe, and ready-to-run immediately after GitHub Pages deployment.
7. Attach any example input files if needed to make the app functional out-of-the-box.


## Setup
Open `index.html` locally or visit the GitHub Pages URL once deployed.

## Usage
The app loads `main.js` to initialize functionality based on the brief and attachments.

## Code Explanation
- `index.html`: main page
- `main.js`: minimal logic for the task
- Assets: copied from attachments when provided
